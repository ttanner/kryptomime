# Force pip upgrade due to security vulnerabilities.

# This has actually has little to do with installing python-gnupg, since
# older versions of pip would install everything just fine. except that, in
# my opinion, using GnuPG for privacy is silly when the installation of
# python-gnupg with an older version of pip is trivially exploitable through
# a MITM attack. see https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/791

# Also, note that SSL package delivery is *not* entirely fixed yet. See

#pip>=1.3.1
#
# NOTE: setuptools is currently (as of 27 May 2013) being merged back into its
# parent project, distribute. By using the included distribute_setup.py
# script, we make sure that we have a recent version of setuptools/distribute,
# which is the *only* Python packaging framework compatible at this point with
# both Python>=2.4 and Python3.x.
#
# A new version of distribute is necessary due to the merging of setuptools
# back into its parent project, distribute. Also, the only way to package for
# both Python 2 and 3 is to use distribute.
#
#distribute>=0.6.45
#
# Sphinx is only necessary for building documentation, so it is added in
# setup.py under extras_require['docs'].
#
# If you want to build the documentation, uncomment this line:
#Sphinx>=1.1
#
# And, this one is actually used in the gnupg module code:
#
gnupg>=1.2.3
